*Jukka Arponen*
My name is Jukka Arponen. I'm a 30 years old Masters Degree student at the University of Eastern Finland. I’ve worked as a software engineer for five years and I have a Bachelor's Degree in Engineering from Savonia University of applied science. I started my masters studies in 2019 and I’m looking forward to learning new things. My hobbies include going to the gym, playing board games and roleplaying games.

*Tony Heikkilä*
*Hi, my name is Tony and this is my fourth year of studying Computer Science in Kuopio. I am 23 years old and my taken courses vary a lot - this might be because I am interested in multiple things OR that I cannot decide. I love martial arts (currently doing kickboxing) and my other hobbies include video games and programming. I also have two cats.

*Antti Auvinen*
*Hi! My name is Antti and I started my Computer Science studies in 2015. I am 23 years old. My plan is to complete my Bachelor's degree this semester/summer. I am doing some Master's Degree courses this academic year, because I don't have many courses left for my bachelor's degree. My interests include exercising, reading, watching tv shows and movies, playing video games, learning about various things related to IT field and I also study Japanese. I have been to Japan for one academic year to do a minor. I'm planning to go back there for doing part of my Master's Degree. My interests in CS vary a lot but I'm interested in doing my Master's thesis about robotics or interactive design.

*Juhana Ullgren*
*Hello there! I'm Juhana, 27 years old and I study computer science here in Kuopio. After getting my bachelor's degree in late 2018, my plan is to get my master's studies done and graduate this year. In computer science my interests are mainly in software development methodologies and my master's thesis topic is about agile methods in large software projects. My hobbies are playing guitar and bass, making music, jogging, biking, going to the gym and reading. 

*Matti Auvinen*
*Hey, I'm Matti. I'm 23 and this is my fourth year studying Computer Science. There are quite a few different areas in CS that could be interesting but I have yet to settle on anything specific. UX is quite relevant and personal in that I sometimes stumble on some feature and can't help wondering why it wasn't done in a better way. My hobbies include working out, gaming, reading and I'm something of a movie buff.
