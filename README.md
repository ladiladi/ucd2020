## Team introductions<a name="team-introductions"/>
* **Manager** – Tony Heikkilä (group management, task specific duties, publicity, reporting)
* **Designer** – Antti Auvinen (creates prototypes and mock-ups)
* **Programmer and data capture** – Jukka Arponen and Matti Auvinen(can add minimal functionality/interactivity, collects user data)
* **Analyst** – Juhana Ullgren (collects data and analyses data, creates actionable recommendations)

*Jukka Arponen:*
My name is Jukka Arponen. I'm a 30 years old Masters Degree student at the University of Eastern Finland. I’ve worked as a software engineer for five years and I have a Bachelor's Degree in Engineering from Savonia University of applied science. I started my masters studies in 2019 and I’m looking forward to learning new things. My hobbies include going to the gym, playing board games and roleplaying games.

*Tony Heikkilä:*
Hi, my name is Tony and this is my fourth year of studying Computer Science in Kuopio. I am 23 years old and my taken courses vary a lot - this might be because I am interested in multiple things OR that I cannot decide. I love martial arts (currently doing kickboxing) and my other hobbies include video games and programming. I also have two cats.

*Antti Auvinen:*
Hi! My name is Antti and I started my Computer Science studies in 2015. I am 23 years old. My plan is to complete my Bachelor's degree this semester/summer. I am doing some Master's Degree courses this academic year, because I don't have many courses left for my bachelor's degree. My interests include exercising, reading, watching tv shows and movies, playing video games, learning about various things related to IT field and I also study Japanese. I have been to Japan for one academic year to do a minor. I'm planning to go back there for doing part of my Master's Degree. My interests in CS vary a lot but I'm interested in doing my Master's thesis about robotics or interactive design.

*Juhana Ullgren:*
Hello there! I'm Juhana, 27 years old and I study computer science here in Kuopio. After getting my bachelor's degree in late 2018, my plan is to get my master's studies done and graduate this year. In computer science my interests are mainly in software development methodologies and my master's thesis topic is about agile methods in large software projects. My hobbies are playing guitar and bass, making music, jogging, biking, going to the gym and reading. 

*Matti Auvinen:*
Hey, I'm Matti. I'm 23 and this is my fourth year studying Computer Science. There are quite a few different areas in CS that could be interesting but I have yet to settle on anything specific. UX is quite relevant and personal in that I sometimes stumble on some feature and can't help wondering why it wasn't done in a better way. My hobbies include working out, gaming, reading and I'm something of a movie buff.

## Chosen project<a name="chosen-project"/>
We chose our topic to concern *Menu comparisons and designs solutions*. This seemed suitable topic for us since we have noticed a lot interesting, challenging and great menus in practice. We want to compare different menu designs on video game digital distribution platforms. The most well-known examples of these platforms are Steam (Valve), Origin (EA), Epic Games Store (Epic Games) and GOG (CD Project). We found Epic Games Store's user interface and menus lacking many features that the other stores currently have. We want to also analyze the value of simplicity in store platforms and how oversimplifying can have negative effect on the user experience. Here are the links to the platforms' webpages:

* [Epic Games Store](https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US)
* [Steam](store.steampowered.com)
* [Origin](https://origin.com)
* https://www.gog.com

We think that many users and possible survey participants have had experience at least with some of these platforms, thus giving as a reasonable amount of data to make conclusions and new menu designs.

## Data collection<a name="data-collection"/>
Due to current situation with the COVID-19 quarantine we decided that the data gathering should be done remotely. The first interviewing is done with Google Forms, where a user can answer our questions freely on their own time, wherever and whenever they want. This low threshold questionnaire hopefully grants us more than few participants so more in-depth analysis can be done. Google Forms is used as a platform widely, so the page/format is probably familiar to the participants. We plan to share the form to other Computer Science students and to our friends. Assuming everyone from our project group invites at least two of their friends to participate, we plan to have at least ten participants.

[Link to our Google Form](https://forms.gle/5aU7YtKUH43YZhH66)

We decided to ask participants' sex and age to see differences in taste and user experiences in different demographics. We are planning to use this to create our two user personas later on. The participants are also asked on which platform they play games. We wanted to see if this has any effect on the feature selection (later on the questionnaire), since most of the digital distribution platforms operate on Windows platform. Users were also asked whether they had used Epic Games Store earlier and how they would rate this user experience. Other video game digital platforms were also introduced in the questionnaire and the users were asked to select the ones they had used. 

![Creating the Google Forms page](https://github.com/ladiladi/ucd2020/blob/master/pictures/creating-form.PNG)

Lastly, users were asked to select 5 features that they valued the most or wanted to be added to Epic Games Store. The features listed are either listed on Epic Games Store's Roadmap [Trello link](https://trello.com/b/GXLc34hk/epic-games-store-roadmap) or are already implemented in other video game online platforms (Steam). We seek to find some insights from the user experiences to make improved designs of the Epic Games Store UI. The data collection will take 1-2 weeks maximum, so we have time for analysis and creating mockups. 

### Features available for selection:
* 3rd Party Keys

The follow-up interview after data analysis and sketching is planned to be more inline with traditional interviewing, with the use of platforms like Discord or Zoom, that offer screensharing and real-time discussion with the participants. Everyone in the team agreed that the Wizard of Oz technique might be a great tool to showcase our new designs of Epic Games Store and how the new designs affect users' thought-process.

[Data analysis and interpretation]<a name="data-analysis"/>
We received 11 responses to our questionnaire. All responders were male, but this may be because of a) males tend to play video games more b) participants were likely the closest friends of our all-male project group c) most of the students in UCD course and other CS courses are male. Age distribution was 21-25 years old (45.5%), 26-30 years old (27.3%) and 31-40 years old (27.3%). Again, this participant group represents the majority of the CS students - young male adults.

![Age distribtution]https://github.com/ladiladi/ucd2020/blob/master/pictures/age-distribution.PNG)

Most of the participants play video games on PC (90.9%), but they also had experiences playing on different platforms: PlayStation (45.5%), Xbox (18.2%), Nintendo (18.2%), Mobile (18.2%).

![Gaming platforms]https://github.com/ladiladi/ucd2020/blob/master/pictures/platforms.PNG)

7 out of 11 participants (63.6%) did not have previous experience with Epic Games Store. These users rated their experience with Epic Game Store with grades 2 (one participant), 3 (two participants) and 4 (one participant). The wished features highlighted here were Friends List and Chat (75%), DRM Free Support (50%), Early Access (50%), Refunds (50%) and User Reviews (50%).

![Features wanted to be added]https://github.com/ladiladi/ucd2020/blob/master/pictures/features-egs.PNG)

There were also two features requested in written section: GDPR Compliance and Shopping Cart.

The participants who had not used Epic Games Store before were questioned about using other video game digital platforms. The responsers answered that six of them have used Valve's Steam (85.7%), four of them have used EA's Origin (57.1%), three of them CD Project's GOG (42.9%), and one for each other selection: None, Uplay Store and PS Store (14.3%).

![Other video game distribution platforms used]https://github.com/ladiladi/ucd2020/blob/master/pictures/non-egs-stores.PNG)

These users were also given features to be rated. The highest rated features were Offline Play (six votes, 85.7%), User Reviews (six votes, 85.7%) and Cloud Saves (five votes, 71.4%). The other features had greater variance.
